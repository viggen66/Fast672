New test for Fast672 Webhost, with direct GoldHen load without use Mira-Loader, making the fastest webhost for 6.72

https://viggen66.github.io/Fast672/

The way this exploit is triggled, it can happen OOM when caching the webhost to the console, just repeat until cache is done with success.

This is the fastest webhost for firmware 6.72 with latest GoldHEN version
